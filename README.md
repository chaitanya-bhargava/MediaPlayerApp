# Media Player
This is a React App built using the concepts of React, React Router, CSS Grid, Iframes and Firebase is used as a Backend.<br/>
A user can store and play their favourite youtube videos without redirecting through this application and also look at the history which lists the videos played in the past. 

### Following features have been implemented:
1. User can create, delete and edit a card
2. Each card can be created under a bucket (eg : Entertainment Videos, Education Videos, etc).
3. The user has the flexibility to name this bucket according to their choice.
4. User can move a card from one bucket to another bucket.
5. On clicking on the card a modal with an iframe opens which starts playing the video.
6. User can delete all the cards under a single bucket at once.
7. There should be a separate tab called history which lists the mp3/mp4 links that the user has played in the past.
